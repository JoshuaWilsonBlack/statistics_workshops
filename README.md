# Statistics Workshops

This Quarto book project contains the introductory R, statistics, and open 
science workshops to be run at [NZILBB](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/nzilbb/) 
from 2024 on.

It will slowly evolve and grow as we continue to run workshops. The aim is that
the material can be worked through independently and that attendees can up 
to speed on previously covered material.
