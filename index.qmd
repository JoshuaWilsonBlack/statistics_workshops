# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This online book contains material for [NZILBB's](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/research/about-uc-research/research-groups-and-centres/new-zealand-institute-of-language-brain-and-behaviour)
R, Stats, and Open Science workshops. The workshops began late in the first 
semester of 2024. As time goes on, this book will expand in both content and
contributors. 

# In-person sessions

I am currently running in-person sessions at NZILBB. We are running two groups:

- An 'introductory' session, working through the material in the 
[Foundations](https://nzilbb.github.io/statistics_workshops/chapters/foundations.html)
section of this book.
- An 'advanced' session, working through material in the [Additional Topics](https://nzilbb.github.io/statistics_workshops/chapters/others.html) section.

The sessions run on alternate weeks from 1-2:30pm in the Brain Box (Elsie Locke
203), with the first intro session on the 24th of July and the first advanced
session the following week.

Announcements are made on the NZILBB Rocket Chat in the #r-stats-open-sci-workshops
channel. If you don't know how to access this, email me at <joshua.black@canterbury.ac.nz>.

# One-on-one help

# Other resources

You may find the following links profitable: 

- The alternative to data analysis with a programming language is usually some 
kind of spreadsheet. Here are some spreadsheet horror stories:

- Why do we have to learn how to program? Why is science 'amateur software 
development'? This is a good lecture on the topic:

  - Usually these techniques aren't explicitly taught. These workshops are our
  attempt to respond to this problem!
- Why can't you do data science with a spreadsheet? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpbtcsGE0OA>
- These workshops have been heavily influenced by @winterStatisticsLinguistsIntroduction2019
