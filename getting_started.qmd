# Getting Started

## Install R and RStudio

R is a programming language. RStudio is a piece of software for interacting
with R.

You don't *have* to use RStudio in order to use R, but we will assume you are
using it in these workshops.^[For alternatives which you might explore see @sec-alternatives]

To install R and RStudio on your own device follow the steps at 
<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.

To install R and RStudio on a University of Canterbury device:

- Windows: open the "Software Center", search for RStudio, and press the install button.
- Mac: open "UC Self Service", search for RStudio, and press the install button.

Installing RStudio on a University of Canterbury device will also install R.

## Open RStudio

If you have installed RStudio, if should now appear in your start menu on
Windows, and your Applications folder and launchpad if you are on macOS. Open
it. You should see something like this:

![The RStudio interface.](images/rstudio.png)\

The RStudio interface has four primary 'panes'. Only three of these will be
visible when you first open RStudio. The largest pane is the **console** pane.
It is usually on the bottom left of the RStudio window, but currently takes up
the entire left side. We also see the **environment** pane at the top right and
the **output** pane at the bottom right.^[You will find different terminology
out there. I'm following the language in the official RStudio User Guide: 
<https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/ui-panes.html>.]

The **console** pane should have a message telling you what version of R you are
using and the platform you are on (i.e. your hardware and operating system).
This is what you would see if you opened R by itself.^[Try this. You should find
a shortcut to open R in the Start menu on Windows or the Launchpad in macOS. On
Linux or macOS you can also open a terminal window, type 'r', and press enter.]

The **environment** pane should be empty. You will see multiple tabs across the
top of this pane. The environment tab will allow us to see the data which we are
working with at a given time. At this stage, you _may_ see a tab labelled
'Tutorial'. I'll tell you how to use this later (@sec-gs-additional).

The **output** pane will start by showing you a list of files on your computer. 
This is useful for finding and manipulating files (just like a file browser) 
In future, it is also where plots and help pages will appear.

## Interact with R in the Console

We will get started by interacting with R in the console pane. You should
see a `> ` in the console pane. We can enter code here. If the code works, we
will see the output immediately below (or perhaps in the output pane, depending
on the code). If the code doesn't work, an error message will appear.

### Basic arithmetic

We'll start with some basic arithmetic. We add two numbers together by writing
the first number, the `+` sign, and the second number. Enter the code in the 
box below after the `> ` in your console. The expected output appears below
the box. You should see the same thing in your console after you press
enter/return.

``` {r}
1 + 1
```

The other basic arithmetic operators work in the same way. Subtraction:

```{r}
500 - 49
```

We use `*` for multiplication. We enter real numbers by using a decimal point.

```{r}
43 * 6.4
```

For exponentiation we use `^` (usually, shift + 6).

```{r}
924^5
```

The output given here is in scientific notation. It is important to be able to
read this notation when using R. It makes very very small and very very large
numbers much easier to write and is often used in the output of R functions. To
convert from scientific notation to regular digits, multiple the number which
appears _before_ the `e` by 10 to the power of the number _after_ the `e`. In
this case, we take the number $6.735345$ and multiply it by $10^{14}$ to get
$673,534,500,000,000$. That is, six hundred seventy-three trillion and a bit.
According to Wikipedia, this is something like the total number of cells in six
and a half adult humans and a bit fewer than the number of ants on Earth.

There are a few different operators associated with division. Usually, you will 
want to use `/`. e.g.:

```{r}
43 / 7
```

Sometimes, it is useful to get the integer component on the answer or the
remainder. If we want the integer, we use `%/%`:
```{r}
43 %/% 7
```

If we want the remainder, we use:
```{r}
43 %% 7
```

That is, if we divide 43 by 7, we get 6 groups of 7, with 1 remaining.

Computer programming requires attention to minor details of punctuation and
spacing. Hours can be spent trying to discover why code is not working, only to
discover a missing comma. This is especially true in the early stages of
learning, where error messages can be very confusing.

It is worth knowing when you can add spaces and when you can't. The spaces in 
the code above between the numbers and the arithmetic operators are not 
necessary. So, for instance, you could write:

```{r}
43/7
```

In fact, you can add however many spaces you like!
```{r}
34  /    2
```

The only reason to prefer one over the other is readability. This raises the
issue of code _style_, which we will discuss in future workshops. Note that,
above, there wasn't a space in `924^5`---this is a style convention for `^` and
some other ('high precedence') operators which we will encounter later.^[You
might want to look at this page: <https://style.tidyverse.org/>. I try to follow
this style guide as much as possible.]

### Vectors and Variables

We work with large collections of experimental data or values derived from
corpora. But the commands we've looked at above only deal with two 
numbers at a time. The simplest structure for dealing with more than one
value is a vector.

We create vectors using the function `c()`. The `c()` function _combines_
values in to a vector.

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

The `[1]` you see in the output is followed by the first element of the vector.
If you print out a very long vector you will see numbers other than 1 inside the
square brackets. For instance:
```{r}
60:124
```
The `:` operator produces a vector from the first number to the second number
(inclusive) in steps of one. The resulting output is long enough that it has
to go across two lines. When the new line starts you will see another number in
square brackets. This tells you how far through the vector you are at the line
break. Exactly _which_ number it is will vary according to the system you
are using. For me, currently editing this text in RStudio, it is `[38]`. That is,
the number which _follows_ `[38]` is the 38th number in the vector.

We call the values in a vector the **elements** of the vector. The elements of a
vector have to be the same _type_ of thing. We'll talk about types more later.
For now, just note that a number is a different kind of thing from a string of
characters. So, what happens if we try to mix numbers and strings in a vector?

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, "dog")
```

R hasn't explicitly complained, but it has done something without telling you
what it has done. The numbers we entered now have quotation marks around them.
They have been turned in to strings. Keep an eye out for quotation marks ---
sometimes you might think you are dealing with numbers, but really you are
dealing with strings. This is a common problem when loading your own data.

Why worry? Well, your code likely won't work if you have strings rather than
numbers. For instance, you can't apply arithmetic operators to strings.

```{r}
#| error: true
"1" + "2"
```

The above is the first **error message** you've seen in this course. You will
see many more in your time working with R. The error message is telling you that
what you are doing does not work on anything but numbers.

To enter a string, you can use either double quotes or single quotes.

Vectors can also be used for arithmetic. Under the hood, statistics is mostly
arithmetic with collections of vectors. How are these arithmetic operations
implemented in R?

The simplest case is when we use a vector and a single number, as follows
```{r}
2 * c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

Each element of the vector has been multiplied by $2$. The same is true of
addition, division, and subtraction. These are 'element-wise' operations. That
is, they are applied to each element individually.
```{r}
3 / c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

This also works with two vectors. For instance:
```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4) * c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```
Here we get the first elements multiplied together, then the second, then 
the third, and so on. 

If one vector is shorter than the other, is will be
'recycled' to match the longer vector:
```{r}
c(1, 2) * c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

You do not want to be entering the same vector over and over again. This is
where **variables** come in. Variables allow us to associate names with values.

To _assign_ an object to a name, we use `<-`. For instance:
```{r}
my_cool_vector <- c(6, 9, 4, 5, 2, 2)
```

Now the name `my_cool_vector` is associated with the vector
`c(6, 9, 4, 5, 2, 2)`. If you look to the top right of the RStudio window you
should now see this variable in your environment pane. The name will be on the
left and the value on the right.

![Our cool vector in the RStudio environment pane. Your screen may look a little different.](images/environment.png)

::: {.callout-warning}
In most cases you can also use `=` to assign an object to a name. This may seem more
natural to you if you are coming from another programming languages. The convention is
to use `<-`. Sometimes `=` takes on a different function, but `<-` is _always_
assignment of an object to a name.
:::

We can now apply operations using the name. For instance:
```{r}
4 * my_cool_vector
```

To see what object is associated with a name we can look in the environment
pane or simply enter the name into the console.
```{r}
my_cool_vector
```

We can also look up specific elements using square brackets. If we wanted to
look up the fourth element in `my_cool_vector` we would enter the following
code.
```{r}
my_cool_vector[4]
```

We can even change elements by using the assignment opperator (`<-`).
```{r}
my_cool_vector[4] <- 3
my_cool_vector
```
The fourth entry in the vector is now `3` rather than `5`.

Naming variables is serious business. It is important to know what you _could_
do and what you _should_ do. 

R institutes the following rules for names:

- A name must consist of letters, digits, `.`, and `_`.
- It **cannot** begin with digits or `_`.
- It cannot come from a list of reserved words (e.g. `TRUE` --- these names have important roles in R and can't be overridden.)

::: {.callout-note}
What counts as a 'letter' varies by operating system and local settings (your
'locale'). The recommendation from Hadley Wickham is that you only use ASCII 
letters (for instance, avoid use of any diacritics/accents).^[See (<https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html>)]

One local reason you might want to use non-ASCII characters is if you want to
use te reo Māori with macrons for your variable names. This might be appropriate for a 
particular project (the question is always who you want to share your code
with). Pretty much anyone using a modern operating system should be able to 
use your code. You may decide that the small risk of incompatibility is worth
it in this case.
:::

I follow the convention of using `_` rather than `.` in my variable names. So,
e.g., I'd prefer `my_cool_vector` over `my.cool.vector`. This reduces ambiguity 
in some cases.

While we are talking about naming, R will accept _anything_ placed within
backticks ('`') as a variable name. If you have a chaotic
temperament, you might decide to use variable names like this:
```{r}
#| error: true
# Eldritch variable

```

Unsurprisingly, if you try this without the backticks, you will get an error:
```{r}
#| error: true
👻 <- 5
```

Do not take advantage of backticks to use names like this.

Why am I even telling you about backticks? They often appear in practice 
as a result of importing data from a spreadsheet. Usually they appear because
the column names in the spreadsheet have spaces in them. One of the first
things to do when tidying up data loading from a spreadsheet is to change the
names.

### Exercises

::: {.webex-check .webex-box}

```{r}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
opts <- c(
   "`c(5, 10)`",
   answer = "`[1]  5  6  7  8  9 10`",
   "`[1]  5  6  7  8  9`"
)

cat("What is the output of `5:10`?", longmcq(opts))
```

```{r}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
opts <- c(
   answer = "`[1] 10 20`",
   "`[1]  30`",
   "`Error in 10 * c(1, 2) : non-numeric argument to binary operator`"
)

cat("What is the output of `10 * c(1, 2)`?", longmcq(opts))
```


```{r}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
opts <- c(
   answer = "`[1] 4`",
   "`[1] 3 4 6 2`"
)

cat("What is the output of `c(3, 4, 6, 2)[2]`?", longmcq(opts))
```

Look at the variable names in the following list.
Some of them are very bad names for _stylistic_ reasons, but will they be 
accepted by R? I.e., are they syntactically valid?

- `nz_vowels` `r torf(TRUE)`
- `_nz_vowels` `r torf(FALSE)`
- `🥝_vowels` `r torf(FALSE)`
- `` `🥝_vowels` `` `r torf(TRUE)`
- `Traditional languages should be taught in school` `r torf(FALSE)`
- `Traditional.languages_should_be.taught.in_school` `r torf(TRUE)`
- `in_school` `r torf(TRUE)`
- `5_points_attitude` `r torf(FALSE)`
- `attitude_5` `r torf(TRUE)`
- `:::::` `r torf(FALSE)`
- `function` `r torf(FALSE)`

## Start an R Script

If we exclusively used R in the console, we would be in no better position than
if we just used Excel or another spreadsheet programme. We want to be able to
retrace our steps.

In order to start an R script go to `File > New File > R Script` or use the 
keyboard shortcut `Cmd + Shift + N` (macOS) or `Ctrl + Shift + N` (Windows).

This will open the **source** pane. We will now enter code in the source pane
rather than the console.^[While you are writing, you may find it occasionally
useful to use the console to double check something. But all steps required
to repeat your analysis should be in a script or markdown (more about markdown
later).]

You can enter R code into a script in the same way you have been adding it to
the console. Unlike the console, each command is saved in the script and 
pressing return/enter will not run the code. 

Usually you will run code by selecting it and pressing `Cmd + Return` (macOS)
or `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows).^[
The same can be achieved by pressing the `Run` button at the top right. But 
since you are likely to be running code very frequently, it is best to learn 
the keyboard shortcut.
] If you have no code selected, this command will run the line which your cursor
is on. The alternative is to run the entire script all at once. This can be done
by pressing `Source` at the top right of the source pane.^[ The keyboard
shortcut for this is `Cmd + Shift + S` (macOS) or `Ctrl + Shift + S` (Windows).
From now on you can look up keyboard shortcuts by using `Option + Shift + K` (macOS)
or `Alt + Shift + K` (Windows).]

Copy and paste the following into your new script then run it. You should see
the output in the console pane.

::: {.callout-note}
There is some wisdom to the idea that you should get coding 'into your fingers'
by typing out examples yourself. This may be true, but it is up to you! I have
enabled the 'copy/paste' button in all code blocks. You should see a clipboard
icon when you have your cursor over a code block. Click the clipboard to copy
the code.
:::

```{r}
my_cool_vector <- c(6, 9, 4, 5, 2, 2)
my_cool_vector ^ 2
```


![The source pane with our script entered. Note the 'Source' button at the right.](images/script.png)

It is important to leave **comments**, so that your code can be interpreted 
by other researchers (including yourself in the future!). Anything which 
appears after a `#` is a comment and will be ignored by R.

We could change our script as follows, and the result will be identical:
```{r}
my_cool_vector <- c(6, 9, 4, 5, 2, 2)
# Square each element of my cool vector and output to console.
my_cool_vector ^ 2
```

In actual data analysis projects, commenting is vital. We'll see some more 
useful examples of commenting as we go on.

### Matrices and Dataframes

In data analysis we want to find associations between multiple variables. So
single vectors aren't going to cut it. We need collections of vectors. 

The simplest version of this is a **matrix**. Matricies are like vectors in 
that they can only contain elements of the same type. 

Add the following lines to your script and run them:
```{r}
my_cool_matrix <- matrix(my_cool_vector, nrow = 3)
my_cool_matrix
```
We now have a $3\times2$ matrix of numbers. 

Square brackets are again used to manipulate individual elements. But we now
have to include both rows and columns. If we want the second column and third
row we can use `my_cool_matrix[3, 2]`. If you want the entire second column 
you would enter `my_cool_matrix[, 2]`. If you want the entire first row, you 
would enter `my_cool_matrix[1, ]`. Try out these commands in either the script
or the console window.

Have a look in the environment pane. You should now see a separation between
"data" and "values". The "data" section contains structured objects, such as
matrices. The one practical difference here is that if you click on something
in the data section it will usually open in a new tab. In this case, you'll
see something that looks a lot like a spreadsheet application. 

Often our data will include elements of multiple different types. For instance,
it might include _numbers_ indicating the age of a participant, or which of a 
series of options they chose. It might also include _words_ (strings) indicating
which experimental condition they are in, or a transcript of an interview. 
Matricies can't handle this, but **data frames** can. 

We create data frames using the `data.frame` function. Enter the following into
your script and run it:
```{r}
# Re-enter the vector to revert modifications made above.
my_cool_vector <- c(6, 9, 4, 5, 2, 2)

my_data_frame <- data.frame(
  "numbers" = my_cool_vector,
  "letters" = c("N", "Z", "I", "L", "B", "B")
)

my_data_frame
```

We now have a data frame with a column of _numbers_ and a column of
corresponding _letters_. We have also given each of these columns a name (
'numbers' for the column of numbers and 'letters' for the column of letters).
Each row of the data frame is an observation, and each
column is a variable.^[More on this in the next session.] Perhaps you can figure
out what the association between the two variables is.

When we have names for columns, we can access the column using the name by 
means of the `$` symbol:
```{r}
my_data_frame$numbers
```

Note the use of a comment to explain why we are re-creating
`my_cool_vector`. This is the kind of step in the middle of a script which is
likely to cause confusion without a comment.

### Functions and Help

We have now seen a few **functions** (`matrix` to create a matrix, and 
`data.frame` to create a data frame). Functions are what we use to perform 
data analysis tasks in R. To apply a function, we writes its name and then
enter a series of **arguments** inside brackets. The arguments are the 
information which we pass for the function in order for it to do its work.

Recall the matrix code from above:
```{r}
#| eval: false
my_cool_matrix <- matrix(my_cool_vector, nrow = 3)
```

Here the `matrix` function is given two arguments. The first is the vector
`my_cool_vector` and the second is `nrow = 3`. The two arguments are separated
by a comma. If we want to work out where these came from, we need to look at 
the help page for the function. To do that enter the following in either the
script or the console:
```{r}
?matrix
```

You should now see the help screen in the output pane (bottom right). This
help page tells you about three related functions. In the 'usage' section, you
will see some code examples which use the functions. The section `arguments`
tells you what you can include as an argument to the function. So, 
for instance, you see that the `nrow` argument expects you to tell it how many
rows you want the matrix to have.

The functions come in the order they appear in the usage example. In this 
case, each of the possible arguments is _named_. So, for instance, the 
first argument is called `data`. We did not enter this explicitly when we 
used the argument. But we could have:
```{r}
#| eval: false
my_cool_matrix <- matrix(data = my_cool_vector, nrow = 3)
```

Sometimes it makes your code more clear to include a name, like this.

The help screen also shows the default values for these argument. If there are
default values, then you don't need to manually enter every argument. If you
are modifying only one argument, which appears latter in the list, then you will
need to use the name. 

For instance, if we wanted to say the matrix has two columns (rather than three
rows), we would have to add `ncol`:
```{r}
my_cool_matrix <- matrix(my_cool_vector, ncol = 3)
my_cool_matrix
```

If we didn't, R would not know what argument we intended to modify. If you 
look in the 'details' section of the help page, you will see that if we only
specify a number of rows or a number of columns, it will attempt to work out
the other value. 

### Install and Use a Package

One of the great advantages of R is that it has a large community of developers
making **packages** to share their code. Packages allow us to cumulatively 
build on each others work and to do things _quickly_ which might otherwise take
a lot of time and statistical knowledge to achieve.

Well start with a silly package: `cowsay`.^[I first became aware of this package
through a tutorial produced by Kevin Watson for LING316.] This package produces
text art animals who will 'say' whatever text you enter.

To install a package, enter the following to the console:
```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages('cowsay')
```

This means that the package `cowsay` is now installed on your computer. To use
it in a script, you need to enter the following at the top of your script:
```{r}
library(cowsay)
```

By convention, we add libraries at the start of a script. This lets other
researchers see exactly what is needed to run the script at the start. In
addition, packages sometimes conflict with one another, and it is important to
see this before we carry out any data analysis.

To see what functions `cowsay` has, look at the documentation. If you want to
see the names of functions, you can enter `cowsay::` and RStudio will suggest
the names of functions. You can add a `?` in front of any of these function
names to see the help file for the function.

There are two functions which come with `cowsay`: `say` and `endless_horse`. 
The function we will use is called `say`, so enter `?say` in
the console.

Now enter the following into your script:
```{r}
#| eval: false
say(
  what = "", # Write your own quote here (between the quotation marks)
  by = "" # Enter a 'type of thing' from the list on the help page.
)
```
Here, I have used comments to indicate what you need to do to complete the 
code. 

Here's one possible answer:
```{r}
say(
  what = "It sure is lonely down here.",
  by = "whale"
)
```

Sometimes packages contain data. This is one day to get data in to your 
analysis.

In fact, there's plenty of data built in to R. Often this is used to demonstrate
different functions. To see these, enter `data()` in the console. You can load
one of these datasets in to your script by entering the name of the dataset
as an argument to the function `data()`. The following code block loads up one
of these datasets.
```{r}
data(warpbreaks)

# This will open up an RStudio window to view that data
View(warpbreaks)
```

There datasets also have help pages (see `?warpbreaks`). What does this
data represent?

As a final bit of R code, and to show you another function in action, let's 
plot the numeric information in `warpbreaks`:
```{r}
hist(warpbreaks$breaks)
```
Here we see the distribution of the count of warp breaks while weaving for a
fixed length of yarn.

### Exercises

::: {.webex-check .webex-box}

```{r}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
opts <- c(
   "`[1] 4`",
   "`2 + 2`",
   answer = "Nothing."
)

cat("What is the output of `# 2 + 2`?", longmcq(opts))
```

Consider the following code to create a matrix:
```{r}
#| eval: false
matrix(
  data = 1:50,
  ncol = 5
)
```

```{r}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
opts <- c(
   "10",
   answer = "5",
   "Not enough information."
)

cat("How many columns does the matrix have?", mcq(opts))
```

Have a look at the documentation for the function `say()`, are the following
statements true or false:

- The default argument value for `by` is `"cat"`. `r torf(TRUE)`
- Kākapo is an option for the `by` argument. `r torf(FALSE)`
-  If you enter `what = "catfact"` the animal will say `"catfact"`. `r torf(FALSE)`.

## Modify RStudio Defaults

There are many useful options which you might want to change to improve your 
RStudio experience. These can be found at `Tools > Global Options`. 

I'm going to assert that you should change some settings in the 'General' window
which will have appeared for you without properly explaining myself.^[
For the rationale see: <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts.html>.
]
Make it so that your settings match the following image:

![The desired state of the General settings.](/images/basic.png)

This means that nothing will be saved between times when you open R. This, in 
turn, means that your script has to contain everything that is important for 
your analysis and you will not accidentally rely on something being carried over
between programming sessions. What do I mean? Well, you might run a piece of
code and then accidentally delete it from the script. The results of running
the code could hang around between sessions and you would not notice your 
mistake. When it comes to sharing your code, the research you share it with
will not be able to run it successfully and it might take a long time to 
discover the problem.

::: {.callout-warning}
If you have been using R for a while, you may be relying on R to keep the result
of long computations between sessions. If so, leave the settings as they are for
now and talk to me (Josh). There are a few ways to save computations so that you
do not have to, say, refit a large model from scratch every time.

You should also modify the appearance of RStudio to your liking using the
`Appearance` options.

## Additional Resources {#sec-gs-additional}

- There are many good R and RStudio tutorials out there. One, which you can use
from within RStudio is `learnr`. Install the package by entering `install.packages('learnr')`
and you should see the tutorials in the environment pane.

- The material which you get in `learnr` is from the book _R for Data Science_,
available here: <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/> 

- See the first chapter of @winterStatisticsLinguistsIntroduction2019

## Alternatives to RStudio {#sec-alternatives}

You can write R code in any text editor which you like. Popular options with more
or less integration of R include:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [ESS](https://ess.r-project.org/) (i.e. *E*macs *S*peaks *S*tatistics).

We won't discuss these alternatives in these workshops. The most likely reason
for you to use one of them is that you are already a keen programmer with
strong preferences concerning your tools.
